Pillar data for Adam Wright's personal cluster
==============================================

Pillar data describes the shape of a `Salt`_ cluster. While all of the
'machinery' of the cluster is defined in my `salt_roots`_, the pillar data
tells the master how that machinery should work all of the minions. Put another
way, if the roots were a function, the pillars would be the arguments given to
that function.
