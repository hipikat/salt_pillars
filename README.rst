Salt Pillar data for Adam Wright's personal cluster
===================================================

Pillar data describes the shape of a cluster. While all of the 'machinery'
of the cluster is defined in my `salt_roots`_, the pillar data tells the Salt
master how that machinery should work all of the minions. Put another way, if
the roots were a function, the pillars would be the arguments given to that
function.
